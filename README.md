# LogoMakerSVG
For this week's Challenge, you'll build a command-line application that takes in user input, generates a logo, and saves it as a scalable vector graphic (SVG) file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Installation

Install npm using:

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage

To start the application and answer the given prompts run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Answer all prompts and the logo.svg file will be created.
