# LogoMakerSVG
For this week's Challenge, you'll build a command-line application that takes in user input, generates a logo, and saves it as a scalable vector graphic (SVG) file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.
